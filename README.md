## Releases

Check out [release](https://github.com/defuncart/game_saves_backup/releases) for the latest release.

If you wish to build from source, you will require:

- Flutter >= 3.13
- Dart >= 3.1
- macOS:
    - Xcode
    - CocoaPods
- linux:
    - clang
    - ninja-build
    - libgtk-3-dev
    - libblkid-dev

The application has not been tested on windows, however it *shouldâ„¢* theoretically work.

## Motivation

I've encountered some issues in which saves for a particular game via emulation are corrupted, or when upgrading proton version for a Heroic prefix, the save data is lost. The goal of this project is to provide a easy way to backup your most important game saves easily. As this is a personal project, currently there is no roadmap, however new features may be developed when deemed required.

## Known Issues

- On Steam Deck Desktop Mode, 'open' game save folder does not work
- On Steam Deck Desktop Mode, back up folder opens to `/home/deck`, even though real path is saved (i.e. `/home/deck/desktop`).
